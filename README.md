## Overview

Hello there! Welcome to my **Pharmacy Data Analysis and Visualization project** repository. I'm excited to take you on a journey through a year's worth of data from A.R Medical and General Pharmacy, spanning from August 2022 to July 2023. Together, we'll uncover hidden gems of insights and trends residing within this treasure trove of data.

## What I Did

- **Data Cleaning and Exploration:** Armed with Python's versatile Pandas library, I rolled up my sleeves and got into the nitty-gritty of the data. I meticulously cleaned up messy data points, sorted out inconsistencies, and transformed raw data into a refined form. The magic of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques came into play next. Visualizing the data, spotting outliers, and identifying patterns were all part of the process.

- **Interactive Visualizations:** Numbers and statistics can be overwhelming. That's why I harnessed the power of Matplotlib to create visualizations that tell a story. Bar charts, line graphs, scatter plots – each of these artistic representations helped me convey intricate details in an easy-to-digest manner. Through these visuals, I was able to unearth trends in pharmacy sales, track seasonal variations, and even catch customer preferences in action.

- **Data's New Home - MySQL:** Data is at its best when it's accessible and organized. To achieve this, I integrated the cleaned and enhanced data into a MySQL database. This strategic move streamlined data management and opened doors to run complex queries with efficiency. Now, anyone with SQL skills can easily extract specific insights and conduct advanced analyses.

- **Dashboard Magic with Power BI:** Hold on to your hats – the showstopper is the interactive dashboard I crafted using Power BI. By connecting this powerful tool to the MySQL database, I turned numbers into actionable insights. The dashboard breathes life into the data, allowing users to navigate through different metrics, filter by date ranges, and even predict future trends.

## How to Get Started

### Prerequisites

- Anaconda Navigator with Python environment
- MySQL Server
- Power BI (for dashboard creation)


## How to Use

1. **Data Exploration:** Begin your exploration by immersing yourself in the world of data. The Jupyter Notebook files in the `data_analysis` directory will be your guides. They'll walk you through the process of cleaning, transforming, and analyzing the data.

2. **Database Integration:** For a deeper dive, head over to the `database_integration` directory. There, you'll find SQL scripts and setup instructions to integrate the cleansed data into a MySQL database. This step enhances data accessibility and sets the stage for advanced queries.

3. **Experience the Insights:** The pinnacle of this project is the interactive dashboard located in the `dashboard` directory. Crafted using Power BI, it bridges the gap between raw data and meaningful insights. Navigate through the various visualizations, slice and dice data, and witness trends unfold.
